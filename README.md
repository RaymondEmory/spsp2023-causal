Introduction to Causal Inference using Causal Diagrams and Potential Outcomes

SPSP 2023 Professional Development Workshop

Saturday, February 25, 2023 | 1:00 â€“ 4:30 PM EST | Hyatt Hanover Hall C

How can researchers draw defensible causal inferences using observational data? This workshop introduces causal diagrams and potential outcomes for addressing this question. I will discuss and demonstrate using causal diagrams to visualize and justify key causal assumptions, and using propensity scores to eliminate confounding. Attendees will learn how to strengthen causal inferences in practice.
